# Template-Engine---Employee-Summary
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

In this project we have used jest for testing and inquirer for collecting the user data.
Writing files in node, creating classes of different emplyee roles using constractor.
